# Quick Scam Paster

This is a small purpose built assistance app to help with manual moderation on Discord.

The main job is to monitor the users clipboard and automatically extract user Id's manually copied from the moderation dashboard or other places and then allow them to be pasted with a preformatted command.



### Auto Paste
Will paste the next ID into the currently active field when ENTER has been pressed.
(E.g. when you send the previous line)

### Auto+
And experimental mode that will register the left mouse click (Confirming a bot button) and tab back into the chat box to type the next command.
